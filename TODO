Fix:
- Add single shot (no tool call, process diffs directly with regex, non agentic)
- Operational mode check
- Must focus on last message
- Check partial file truncation and full per file file cut on context size checking
- By some reason, Readme (markdowns dif patching) are not working
- Fix context search folders
- Apply patch should be able analyse if patch was applied correctly and raise if not
- On page load, scroll to the end
- Check the amount of events received by usage handler (seems spammy)
- SHALL MAKE EXPLICIT THAT ASK CANNOT WRITE

--------
